Mask R-CNN models should be in this directory.

These models are large and therefore they need to be downloaded separately.
You can download these models from URL:
https://mega.nz/folder/Ing3RaRA#UU66txug51g2RgQS7sl9Dg

Each model should have exaclty defined name otherwise, the application may not work properly.

The names must be as follows:
mask_rcnn_fingeprints_resnet50_heads.h5
mask_rcnn_fingeprints_resnet50_all.h5
mask_rcnn_fingeprints_resnet101_heads.h5
mask_rcnn_fingeprints_resnet101_all.h5
