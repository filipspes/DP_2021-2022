YOLOv5 models should be in this directory.

Some of these models are are large (Medium, Large, XLarge) and therefore they need to be downloaded separately.
You can download these models from URL:
https://mega.nz/folder/piJXUIBQ#jUNc8qFzc109E0c-tEJbNg

Each model should have exaclty defined name otherwise, the application may not work properly.

The names must be as follows:
YOLOv5_Nano_weights.pt
YOLOv5_Small_weights.pt
YOLOv5_Medium_weights.pt
YOLOv5_Large_weights.pt
YOLOv5_Small_weights.tp
